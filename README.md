# Face-Mask-Recognition
To detect human faces in a Video frame, and then predict the usage of Face Mask.

#In this project, I am tasked with building a CNN model that takes a isolated picture of a human face as input and predicts the usage of Face Mask.

I made this project in a group of 4, the above is my assigned task. I had to also work in fine tuning the DNN model that detects all human faces in a frame, isoltes it and send the same to the CNN model. I also experienced using OpenCV to manuplate the image and showcase the predictions onto the frame clearly.

Flowing the below Architecture.

Example of the working CNN:

Example of the resultant Video Frame with OpenCV:

Thus the project is succesful at recognize all Human faces in a Frame, Predicting the usage of face mask in all the faces and is all in real time. The input video can be Live CCTV footage, Webcam Input or a Video file. :)
