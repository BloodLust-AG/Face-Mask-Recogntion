# Face-Mask-Recogntion
To detect human faces in a Video frame, and then predict the usage of Face Mask.

#In this project, I am tasked with building a CNN model that takes a isolated picture of a human face as input and predicts the usage of Face Mask.

I made this project with a group of 4, the above is my assigned task. I had to also work in fine tuning the DNN model that detects all human faces in a frame, isoltes it and send the same to the CNN model.![flow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109036254/178154897-61006044-7d66-49c0-ad5e-d24e87b9b2d5.png)
