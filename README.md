# Face-Mask-Recognition
To detect human faces in a Video frame, and then predict the usage of Face Mask.

#In this project, I am tasked with building a CNN model that takes a isolated picture of a human face as input and predicts the usage of Face Mask.

I made this project in a group of 4, the above is my assigned task. I had to also work in fine tuning the DNN model that detects all human faces in a frame, isoltes it and send the same to the CNN model.

Flowing the above Architecture, the project is succesful at recognize all Human faces in a Frame, Predicting the usage of face mask in all the faces and is all in real time. The input video can be Live CCTV footage, Webcam Input or a Video file.
